# Agents Course (by Hugging Face)

## What to expect from this course?

In this course, you will:
* 📖 Study AI Agents in __theory, design, and practice__.
* 🧑‍💻 Learn to __use established AI Agent libraries__ such as smolagents, LangChain, and LlamaIndex.
* 💾 __Share your agents__ on the Hugging Face Hub and explore agents created by the community.
* 🏆 Participate in challenges where you will __evaluate your agents against other students’__.
* 🎓 __Earn a certificate of completion__ by completing assignments.
And more!

At the end of this course you’ll understand __how Agents work and how to build your own Agents using the latest libraries and tools__.

## What does the course look like?

The course is composed of:
* _Foundational Units_: where you learn Agents __concepts in theory__.
* _Hands-on_: where you’ll learn __to use established AI Agent libraries__ to train your agents in unique environments. These hands-on sections will be __Hugging Face Spaces__ with a pre-configured environment.
* _Use case assignments_: where you’ll apply the concepts you’ve learned to solve a real-world problem that you’ll choose.
* _The Challenge_: you’ll get to put your agent to compete against other agents in a challenge. There will also be [a leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/huggingface-projects/AI-Agents-Leaderboard) (not available yet) for you to compare the agents’ performance.
